To compile this program, you can use the makefile by typing make into the command line on ada while 
in the correct directory. You can also compile by hand by typing javac GenAlg.java. 

To run the program, type java GenAlg into the command line. 

The outputs for this program will be of the form:

Generaton Number: n
Average fitness: x.x
X: xxxxxxxxxx Y: xxxxxxxxxx Z: xxxxxxxxxx    fitness: x.x
.
.
.


The first line is the current generation number, the second line is this generation's average fitness.
The next line shows the chromosomes for each of the individuals in the population. 
These will be in the order X Y Z and at the end of this line is the individual's fitness. 

This program will run until the average fitness of the population is 0. This means that the population has found a solution. 

The current population size is 20 and the chance of a mutation occuring is 1 in 100 per child. 
These can be changed on lines 16 and 17 respectivly.
